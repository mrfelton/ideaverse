Keep your [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) vault organized, connected, and healthy using proven knowledge management systems. Built on the ACE framework (Atlas/Calendar/Efforts), [LYT (Linking Your Thinking)](https://linkingyourthinking.com) conventions, and the ARC workflow (Add - Relate - Communicate).

## What you get

Three complementary skills that work together:

- **[ideaverse](skills/ideaverse/SKILL.md)** - Create notes, build MOCs, link concepts, maintain structure
- **[ideaverse-enrichment](skills/ideaverse-enrichment/SKILL.md)** - Process articles and research, extract concepts, catch duplicates
- **[ideaverse-maintenance](skills/ideaverse-maintenance/SKILL.md)** - Audit your vault, find broken links, identify orphaned notes

## Effective workflows

**Audit and identify gaps:**

> Run a full vault audit. Show me squeeze points (concepts referenced 10+ times without a MOC) so I know where to build new structure

> Find all orphan notes in my vault. Tell me which ones could be linked to existing MOCs versus archived

> Check my frontmatter compliance and identify notes missing required metadata

**Assimilate knowledge systematically:**

> I've collected 8 research papers on event sourcing. Process them one by one: extract core concepts, classify each as principle/pattern/concept, check for duplicates before creating notes

> Add these bookmarks from my vault. For each: extract atomic concepts, check if they already exist, add to appropriate MOC with proper relationships

> Extract the actionable workflows from this article and create process notes linked to existing related concepts

**Link and improve structure:**

> I see Distributed Systems is referenced 34 times. Create a MOC for it, reorganize related notes underneath, and show me the new structure

> Review my APIs MOC and identify child concepts that lack proper definition or are missing connections to related patterns

> Find all notes linking to Microservices but not yet organized. Create hierarchy and add them to a coherent MOC

**Maintain vault health:**

> Find broken links introduced recently and fix them

> Which notes haven't been touched in 3+ months and might be candidates for archival?

> Show me if my MOCs are getting bloated (which ones exceed 50 links and should be split?)
